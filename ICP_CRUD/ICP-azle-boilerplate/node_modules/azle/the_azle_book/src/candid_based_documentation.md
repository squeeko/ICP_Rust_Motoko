# Old Candid-based Documentation

> This entire section of the documentation may be out of date

Azle is currently going through a transition to give higher priority to utilizing HTTP, REST, JSON, and other familiar web technologies. This is in contrast to having previously focused on ICP-specific technologies like [Candid](./candid.md) and explicitly creating `Canister` objects with [query](./query_methods.md) and [update](./update_methods.md) methods.

We are calling these two paradigms HTTP-based and Candid-based. Many concepts from the [Candid-based documentation](./candid_based_documentation.md) are still applicable in the HTTP-based paradigm. The HTTP-based paradigm simply focuses on changing the communication and serialization strategies to be more web-focused and less custom.
